"""Say whether a repository has an adoption already, by the sweep's own rule.

The sweep (scripts/sweep.py) passes over a repository whose default branch
holds docs/agents/PROTOCOL.md, which every adoption from this front door
brings, in either kind, and every copy made with "Use this template"
carries; the installation's path of the form asks the same through
sweep.unadopted (scripts/resolve.py). A repository named on the form
reaches .github/workflows/adopt-run.yml by neither, and a second adoption
would put the template's files over the ones the repository has made its
own since (its CLAUDE.md and checkpoint, its README, its goal and memory,
its metrics switch), or, for the protocol alone, bring back what it has
taken out, so the run asks this before it reads the kind or stages a
file, on every path: one rule, sweep.is_adopted itself, for the three
ways a request arrives. scripts/adopt.py apply refuses an adoption that
could not write that file, so no adoption is made that the rule misses.

Exit 0 when the repository has no adoption yet, 3 when it has one, which
the run answers with one message that names nothing of it, 1 when GitHub
could not be asked, and 2 when GH_TOKEN is not set or the name is missing
or not one scripts/adopt.py name would print. With --answer it asks
nothing and prints that message, ANSWER, the one place its words are
kept: the run answers with it, and so does .github/workflows/adopt.yml,
which asks this before it sends the administrator of a named repository
to install Symphony Setup for a request the run would refuse. Nothing
printed names the repository, since the run's log is public and a
repository given by ids may be private. GH_TOKEN is an installation token
for the repository that reads its contents, and it is never printed.
Python 3.12 or later, standard library only.
