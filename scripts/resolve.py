"""Turn the installation a form carried into the repositories to adopt.

The install ends on the adoption form with the installation's number
filled in, and the person presses Create: .github/workflows/adopt.yml runs
this to learn which repositories that means, all by id, so that the public
run never holds a name it could print. The number may be the App's own
installation or the Setup App's, since both Apps send the person to the
form; a Setup App installation stands for the App's installation on the
same account, narrowed to the repositories the Setup App was given.

Of the installation's repositories, those with no adoption yet (the
sweep's own rules in sweep.py: a commit, no branch symphony/adopt, no
docs/agents/PROTOCOL.md, no opt-out) that the issue's author administers
are the ones to adopt, newest first, at most LIMIT of them: one, the
newest, so that one press never reaches further than one repository (on
2026-10-11 an installation on all of an account's repositories, with
"Merge the pull request for me" ticked, merged the adoption into eight
before the run was cancelled); the person presses Create again for the
next, or names a repository on the form. With SETUP_JWT set, only a
repository the Setup App is installed on is a candidate, asked by id with
that App's JWT before the newest is chosen: the Setup App's installation
is the person's choice of repository and their consent to the settings it
applies for the one run, so an account with the App on all its
repositories and the Setup App on one gets that one. Without SETUP_JWT
there is no such filter. The file --out
gets installation_id, repository_ids (a JSON list) and count, as KEY=value
lines for $GITHUB_OUTPUT; stdout says how many and nothing else.

Exit 0 with something to adopt; 3 when there is nothing (an installation
that is neither App's, no repository with no adoption yet, none the
author administers, or none the Setup App reaches), which the workflow
answers with one message whatever the reason; 4 when the App's own record
cannot be read, which is the front door's owner's problem; 1 when GitHub
could not be asked. APP_JWT is the App's JWT (scripts/jwt.sh); SETUP_JWT,
when set, the Setup App's. Python 3.12 or later, standard library only.
