# Symphony GitHub Apps privacy statement

Version 10, 2026-10-18. This text is also at https://openspineconsortium.com/symphony/apps-privacy.html.
The Symphony browser extension has a statement of its own, at https://openspineconsortium.com/symphony/privacy.html.

Who makes the Apps: Gregory Schwing, trading as OpenSpineConsortium ("the developer"). Questions:
the contact on https://openspineconsortium.com/symphony/.

Symphony is two GitHub Apps. **SymphonyBoard** (github.com/apps/symphonyboard) brings the Symphony
template, or its claim protocol, into a repository by pull request, and afterwards reads one branch
of that repository once a day for anonymous aggregates. **Symphony Setup** (github.com/apps/symphony-setup)
applies up to six settings to a repository for one run and uninstalls itself. Both work only through
GitHub: nothing of yours goes anywhere but to GitHub's own API, to your own repository and, as
aggregates, to the developer. This statement says what each App can see, what it writes, what the
developer receives and keeps, and how to stop any of it.

## What each App asks for, and why

The unit of consent is the installation. Whatever repositories you give an App when you install it
("All repositories" or "Only select repositories"), the App can read what its permissions allow on
every one of them, and this statement applies to each.

SymphonyBoard asks for six repository permissions: Contents (read and write), to read your default
branch and push the branch `symphony/adopt` and, in a repository with no commit yet, to make its first
commit, a README; Pull requests (read and write), to open the adoption
pull request and, only when you asked for it on the form, merge it; Issues (read and write), to
make the board's labels and, in a new repository, open the issue "Set up this project"; Checks (read
and write), to post the protocol check as a check run where the developer runs the App's server;
Workflows (read and write), because the pull request brings files under `.github/workflows`, which
GitHub lets no token write without it; and Metadata (read), which every App has, to list the
repositories it reaches. It subscribes to five event types (issues, issue comments, pull requests,
pushes and check suites), which GitHub delivers only while the App's webhook is turned on; as this
statement is written, it is turned off, and the section on the server below applies from the day
it is turned on. SymphonyBoard never asks for Administration.

On an organization, SymphonyBoard also asks for two organization permissions: Secrets (read and
write) and Variables (read and write), for the control panel's Tokens page, which saves a Claude
account's token as one of the organization's Actions secrets when an owner of the organization asks
it to (the control panel, below). The App itself never reads or writes a secret or a variable: only
a page you are signed in to does, as you, and GitHub lets it only where you are an owner of the
organization. GitHub never gives a secret's value back to anyone, the App included.

Symphony Setup asks for two permissions and nothing else: Administration (read and write), for the
six settings below, and Metadata (read). It has no webhook and receives no event. It is meant to be
installed on the one repository being adopted, for the one run, and the run uninstalls it when that
repository was the only one it reached, after the adoption or after a request refused because the
repository is adopted already; otherwise the pull request, or that refusal's answer, asks you to
uninstall it.

## The adoption

Installing SymphonyBoard sends you on to Symphony Setup's install page, and that install
sends you to a public form on the front door repository,
github.com/OpenSpineConsortium/symphony-start. Pressing Create there opens a public issue in your
GitHub name; the issue carries what the form held (your installation's number, or a repository name
you typed, the kind, the merge choice and one box) and the run's answers, and it is closed when the run is done,
never deleted. A repository the run learns only by its number is never named on the front door: its
name, its owner's, its default branch's and your login are masked in the run's public log, and the
issue is answered with "your repository". A name you typed into the form is public already, and the
run names it in its answers. The front door's public logs do show the installation's number, the
repository's numeric id, the kind the run read (whether the repository was empty), how many files
it added, replaced, kept or skipped, and the commit ids of your default branch and of the template.

To do its work the run reads, from the repository being adopted: the default branch and the commit
on it or, where the default branch is not there yet, whether the repository has any branch at all,
whether a branch `symphony/adopt` exists and has a pull request, whether `docs/agents/PROTOCOL.md`
exists, the one word in `.github/symphony-adopt` and `.github/symphony-metrics` and in each under
its name before the rename to Symphony, `.github/sdlc-adopt` and `.github/sdlc-metrics`, the full
listing of the default branch's tree (to decide the kind), a checkout of that branch at depth one (to add the
files) and whether you administer the repository. With Symphony Setup installed, the run also reads the repository's rulesets, its
topics and its workflow permissions for GitHub Actions, to leave what is there as it is. When the
form carries an installation's number and no name, the run reads that installation's record and,
when the number is Symphony Setup's, SymphonyBoard's own list of its installations, to find the one
on the same account; then it asks the same of each repository both Apps reach, and whether you
administer it, to choose the newest one with no adoption yet. Everything
read lives on GitHub's runner for the length of the run and goes with it; nothing of it is kept or
sent elsewhere.

What the run writes to your repository, as the App's bot: the board's labels, one commit on the
branch `symphony/adopt`, one pull request from it, and, in a repository that held nothing yet, the
issue "Set up this project". In a repository with no commit at all, the run first makes one, as
GitHub's own "Add a README file" does: a `README.md` holding the repository's name, on the default
branch, which the pull request goes into; the whole template's README takes its place when you merge. The pull request's body lists every file it brings, names the GitHub
login of the person who asked, says whether the
repository is private and, where the Setup App was installed, quotes GitHub's own answer for each
setting, which may name your account's plan; in an organization's new repository, the pull request
also writes that login into `.github/CODEOWNERS`. With Symphony Setup installed, the run creates the
default branch's ruleset, turns on delete-head-branches and auto-merge, adds the topic `symphony` to
the repository's topics (the sign on the repository's page that it is adopted, which anyone can see
there and the Symphony browser extension reads from the page; your other topics stay), turns on
secret scanning and push protection where your plan and visibility allow it, and, in a repository
that takes the whole template, ticks "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" where
your organization and its enterprise allow it, then revokes the Setup App's token and uninstalls
the Setup App when the repository was its only one. Unless you chose on the form to review the pull request
first, the run merges it or arms auto-merge. Everything else lands only
when you merge. Closing the pull request instead leaves the labels, the README the run made in a
repository that had no commit, the branch, the settings, the topic and the issue for you to undo.

The adoption's files come from the developer's private template repository, read with a token that
holds Contents read on that one repository and is revoked right after the checkout; only the files
in the pull request reach you.

## Field metrics: what the developer receives

A repository Symphony set up runs its own workflow once a day, with GitHub's own token, which writes
one file, `METRICS.json`, to a branch named `metrics` of your repository: eleven counts (claims,
pull requests opened, merged, closed unmerged, reviews, changes requested, check runs passed and
failed, conflicts seen, released claims, contributors), the median and 90th percentile of three
waits in seconds, two rates, the time it was made, the number of days it covers (30), the protocol's
release number and the short id of its commit, and the words that name the schema and the switch.
Since version 2 of this statement the file also holds counts of how the work ran in parallel, so
that failure can be compared between one person running several Claude Code sessions at once and
several people working at once: seventeen counts of the people who opened pull requests, the Claude
Code sessions named on them, how many named one, the most pull requests, people and sessions of one
person at work at the same moment, the conflicts the board marked or GitHub reports on open pull
requests, and the pull requests the run could not read in full; for each of eight work settings
(nothing else at work beside it; one session's several pull requests; one person's several sessions;
several people; several people beside one person's several sessions; not known; the repository's own
Claude workflows; other apps and bots), thirteen counts and sums for the pull requests that ended in
the 30 days and those still open, such as how many merged, met a conflict or shared a changed file
with work beside them, and how long they were at work; and, for four kinds of pairs of pull requests
at work at the same time, seven counts of how many pairs there were and how many worked at once,
shared a file, had one land while the other was open, or met in conflict when it did. Since version
3 it also holds what the work cost, so that the cost of coordination can be measured: the date of
the price list the estimate uses; counts of the pull requests that ended in the 30 days, of those
merged and of those with any usage recorded against them, of the Claude Code sessions and the runs
of the repository's Claude workflows that recorded usage, and of the records left for a later run;
the tokens Claude used, by kind (input, cache writes, cache reads, output, in all, and those of a
model the price list does not know) and by model family (the fixed words fable, opus, sonnet, haiku
and other, never a model's name); what those tokens would cost at Anthropic's API list prices, in
dollars, and the part of it the coordinator workflow spent; the seconds Claude was at work; the
commits, failed checks and reverts of those pull requests; four of these per merged pull request;
and, for the pull requests done alone and those done with other work beside them, thirteen counts
and sums each (pull requests, merged, measured, measured and merged, tokens, dollars, seconds,
commits, failed checks, first checks passed and judged, the median wait from opening to merge, and
the time at work), with seven ratios between the two. To make the
file the workflow reads from GitHub's API, in its memory only and for the length of the run, the
pull requests changed in the 30 days and in the 30 before them, their commits, reviews, check runs
and changed files, the comments made or edited on the repository's issues and pull requests in
those 60 days, its branches and, for each claim branch with no pull request changed in the 30 days,
its newest commit; to sort the pull requests it uses the login of the person who opened each one, the
name of its branch, the Claude Code session link a cloud session writes into its commit messages and
pull request descriptions (and a line `Symphony-Session:` where a session writes one) and the times
of its commits, and to see whose files meet, the names of the files each changed; it writes none of
them. For what the work cost it reads two records the template's own tools leave in your
repository, never anything from the App: the line `Symphony-Usage:` that a Claude Code session of
the repository adds to each of its commit messages, holding token counts by model, the seconds the
session was at work and the first eight characters of the session's id, and no word of its
conversation; and the usage record each run of the repository's Claude workflows keeps as an
artifact of that run, holding token counts by model, seconds, turns, the workflow, the job and the
worker's name, and the issue and pull request the run was for, and nothing of the conversation.
It lists and downloads those artifacts with the repository's own token, from the last 60 days, and
keeps the records it has read in the repository's own Actions cache, so the next day's run reads
only the new ones. The file holds no name, login, session link or session id, title, branch name,
file name, link, issue number, model name, worker name, text or code; a test in the template fails
if any of those reaches the file.
Where a repository has few pull requests a count can describe a single one, and the counts say how a
project works, for instance that one person had three sessions' work going at once. The branch is as
visible as your repository. A maintainer of your project who chooses to run the template's judge on
their own computer, with their own Claude Code account, adds a second file, `JUDGE.json`, holding
counts of communication failure types, of the conversations it judged and of those that had two or
more people, in all and for each work setting, the totals of the failure types' three groups, the
number of pull requests it covered that ended in the 30 days, in each work setting, the number of
days it covered and any limit it ran under, the time it was made, which model and which version of its prompt it used, and the
word that names its schema; the App never runs that judge and only reads that file.

Once a day, at 04:17 UTC, the developer's collector lists the repositories every installation of
SymphonyBoard reaches (receiving from GitHub their names, owners and visibility, which it holds in
memory and never writes) and asks each for exactly those two files at the ref `metrics`, and for no
other path. It keeps a project's `METRICS.json` only when the file says sharing is on; otherwise
nothing of that project is stored and `JUDGE.json` is not read. Of each file it keeps a fixed list
of numbers, the time the file was made, the date of the price list and the few identifier-shaped
words named above; a value of another shape is dropped. The names of the work settings, of the kinds
of pairs, of the model families and of the two sides of the comparison are fixed words of the
template, the same in every repository's file, never words of your project. The developer
therefore learns, per repository and day, how the protocol performed in numbers, and nothing of what
the work was.

Each kept line names the repository only as a keyed hash (HMAC-SHA256) of its GitHub node id under a
secret the developer alone holds, derived from the App's private key or set separately, so the
developer can follow one repository's numbers from day to day, and across a rename or transfer,
without the dataset naming it; a reader of the dataset without that secret cannot tell which
repository a line is. Rotating the key or the secret gives every repository a new hash and ends the
thread. The dataset is a private branch of the developer's repository, one JSON line per repository
and day, with no expiry: lines are added beside earlier days', a second run on the same day replaces
that day's, and the branch's git history keeps every earlier version for as long as the branch
exists. It is read by the developer and by the collaborators on that private repository, for
research on how coordination fails and succeeds among Claude Code sessions; it is never sold and
never given to anyone else. The developer runs the collector on GitHub Actions; it talks to
api.github.com and nowhere else.

## Sharing is on by default, with three ways off

Sharing is on unless you turn it off: the adoption writes `on` into `.github/symphony-metrics`
unless you ticked the form's box "Do not share anonymous aggregates" or a switch of the repository's
own says `off` already, under that name or under `.github/sdlc-metrics`, its name before the rename
to Symphony, which the adoption never turns on.
Where the switch cannot be written, because the repository ignores it or something of its own
stands where it goes, nothing the adoption brings shares: the protocol alone then brings no metrics
workflow, and the whole template's reads what stands in the switch's place as off. To turn
it off at any time: write `off` as the first word of `.github/symphony-metrics` on your default
branch (in a repository adopted before the rename, whose workflow reads only `.github/sdlc-metrics`,
write it there), or set the repository Actions variable `SDLC_METRICS` to `off` (and run the
workflow once, so the record on the branch says off), or uninstall SymphonyBoard, after which the
collector reaches nothing of yours. Disabling the workflow alone does not stop sharing, because the
branch keeps its last record and the collector reads it as that day's; turn the switch off first.
With the switch off the template's sessions also stop adding the `Symphony-Usage:` line to their
commits and its Claude workflows stop keeping usage records, and a person who wants no usage of
theirs on their commits whatever the repository says sets `SDLC_METRICS` to `off` in their own
environment. Lines already collected stay in the dataset under the hash; they carry nothing that
names you.

## The control panel

The control panel is a page of the developer's site, https://openspineconsortium.com/symphony/control/,
and the cost page beside it, https://openspineconsortium.com/symphony/cost.html. Both are static
files that work in your browser with a GitHub token you give them, and they talk to GitHub's own API
as you and, only when you sign in with GitHub, to the sign-in service described below. They read
your own account's login (to say who is signed in), your repository's board (the file STATE.md on
the branch `board`), its open issues and their labels, the worker files under
`.github/symphony/workers/`, its open pull requests and the check runs on their heads, its Actions
runs, the repository's own record (its default branch, whether it is private, its topics and, for one
you name, its numeric id and its owner's, to build the App's install link with that repository
selected), on the cost page the file METRICS.json on the branch `metrics`, and, when you press "Find
my Symphony repositories", the names and topics of the repositories your token reaches, up to three
hundred of the most recently pushed, to keep the ones carrying the topic symphony. Only when you
press the button that says so, they write what GitHub's own pages would: an issue (a task, an "Add a
worker" issue, or one that mentions @claude), a comment, a label on an issue (and the label itself
when it is not there yet), a workflow run started by hand, or a merge.

The token is one of two kinds, and either way it stays in your browser. A fine-grained personal
access token you make on GitHub and paste into the page is first sent to GitHub alone, to ask whose
it is, and kept only once GitHub accepts it: in the browser's storage until you press "Forget the
token", or, when you did not tick "Keep me signed in", in the tab's own storage, which the browser
clears when the tab closes and brings back with the tab when it reopens or restores it. With "Sign
in with GitHub", GitHub issues, after you allow it on GitHub's own page, a token of SymphonyBoard's
that acts as you within the App's permissions and your own access on the repositories it is
installed on, and expires in eight hours; beside it GitHub issues a refresh token, valid six months,
with which the page renews the token. GitHub sends your browser back to the page with a one-time
code; the page sends that code, with a one-time secret it made for this sign-in, to the sign-in
service, a small program of the developer's run on Cloudflare's Workers platform, which adds the
App's client secret, asks GitHub for the token and hands back the token and the refresh token; the
page renews the token by sending the service the refresh token the same way. With "Keep me signed
in" ticked, the page keeps both in the browser's storage until you press "Forget the token".
Unticked, it keeps the token in the tab's own storage, as it keeps a pasted token, and the refresh
token in the open page's memory alone, never in the browser's storage, so that the renewals end once
that page is gone, closed, reloaded or replaced by another page such as the cost page, and the
sign-in then ends with its eight-hour token. When a new sign-in, or a token you paste that GitHub
accepts, takes the place of a sign-in's token, the page has the service ask GitHub to revoke the one
it replaced, as "Forget the token" does. The service keeps nothing: no store, no cookie, and no log
of its own of the code, the tokens or you; it answers no origin but the site's; and its host's own
request logs are turned off, though Cloudflare, which carries the request, sees its address and
timing under Cloudflare's own privacy policy. The developer receives nothing from the pages but what
that service passes through in the moment: never a token to keep, never a name, never a count.
Beside the token, the page keeps in your browser the names of the repositories you listed and the
plan you chose on the cost page.

The aggregates the collector reads are as the section on field metrics says, whether or not you use
the pages. The pages never show a repository's Claude secret, which GitHub never gives back. The
one Claude token they take is one you paste into the Tokens page's "Add or renew a slot": the page
seals it in your browser with your organization's public key from GitHub (for a personal account's
repository, the repository's), the way GitHub's own secrets page does, and sends GitHub only that
sealed box, which GitHub alone can open, as the secret SYMPHONY_CLAUDE_1 to SYMPHONY_CLAUDE_8 or
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, seen by the repositories you tick. It then writes, as organization (or
repository) variables, the slot's label if you gave one and the list SYMPHONY_CLAUDE_ACCOUNTS. The
token goes nowhere else: not to the sign-in service, not to the developer, not into the browser's
storage, a log or the page; the page empties its box once the token is sealed. A slot is removed on
GitHub under the organization's Settings, Secrets and variables, Actions. What
they start, a worker's run or the Claude workflow's answer to a mention, runs on the token the
repository holds, as the repository's own workflows do. To stop: press "Forget the token", which
drops the token and the refresh token from the browser and, for a token from "Sign in with
GitHub", asks GitHub through the service to revoke the token; a personal access token is revoked
on GitHub under Settings, Developer settings, Personal access tokens, and the App's authorization,
which covers every token and refresh token it issued you, under Settings, Applications, Authorized
GitHub Apps.

## The App's server, where it is run

SymphonyBoard's webhook server, when the developer turns the webhook on, receives from GitHub each
event the App subscribes to, acts on pull request events only (opened, synchronize, reopened, ready
for review, converted to draft, edited) and logs and ignores the rest. For a pull request event it
reads the action, the installation's id, the repository's full name and the pull request's number
from the delivery, then reads the pull request from the API (its head and base, its body, whether
it is a draft and its head commit) and whether the claim file for its issue exists at that commit,
and writes one thing: the check run `sdlc/protocol` on that commit, with a title and a summary that
lists each protocol problem in one line. It posts no comment. It verifies every delivery's signature
before reading it, keeps installation tokens in memory for at most an hour and stores nothing on
disk; its log holds one line per delivery with the time, the delivery's id, the event, the action,
the repository's full name, the duration and a short outcome, and never a token, a payload or a
person's words.

## Keys and tokens

Each App's private key is the developer's and is never given to anyone: it lives in the Actions
secrets of the developer's own repositories and in the server's environment, outside any
repository. Every token minted from it is an installation token that lives one hour, asked with the
fewest permissions the step needs (metadata alone to resolve a number, contents read to read, the
four write permissions only for the adoption itself) and revoked as soon as the step is done where
the code can. No token, key or signature is ever printed to a log.

## What the Apps never do

They send nothing to any service but GitHub's own API. They have no analytics, no error reporting
and no third party. SymphonyBoard never holds Administration on anyone's repository; Symphony Setup
holds it for one run and only where you installed it. They read your repository's code only as the
adoption above says (the tree listing, a one-commit checkout of the default branch, and the few
files named), never to keep or send it. They never write to a repository but the adoption's branch,
pull request, labels, issue and settings, each of them yours to undo, and the README that begins a
repository with no commit. They never read a Claude credential (a token you paste into the Tokens page is sealed in your browser
for GitHub, and neither App nor the developer can read it), and nothing here runs on
anyone's Claude account but the one a project's own maintainer chooses to run the judge with.

## Uninstalling

Uninstalling SymphonyBoard stops the collector from reading anything of yours and
undoes nothing in your repository: the files, labels, branch, settings and issues the adoption made
stay yours. Uninstalling Symphony Setup is what you do once the pull request is open, when the run
did not do it for you.

## Children

Symphony is for people who administer GitHub repositories. It is not directed at children.

## Changes

A new version of this statement is published at https://openspineconsortium.com/symphony/apps-privacy.html
and in the front door repository, github.com/OpenSpineConsortium/symphony-start, whose PRIVACY.md is
this text.

Version 10 adds SymphonyBoard's two organization permissions, Secrets and Variables (read and
write), and the Tokens page's "Add or renew a slot", which seals a Claude token you paste in your
browser and saves it, as you, as one of your organization's Actions secrets, with its label and
the list of slots as variables. Nothing the developer receives or keeps changed.

Version 9 says where a sign-in for one tab keeps its refresh token: in the open page's memory alone,
never in the browser's storage, so that the renewals end once that page is closed, reloaded or
replaced by another page, and the sign-in then ends with its eight-hour token; that the tab's own
storage comes back with a tab the browser reopens or restores; that a pasted token is asked about at
GitHub before the page keeps it; and that a sign-in's token that a new sign-in or an accepted pasted
token replaces is revoked through the service, as "Forget the token" revokes one. Nothing the
developer receives or keeps changed.

Version 8 adds the control panel and the cost page of the developer's site, as the section of that
name says: pages that work in your browser with a GitHub token you give them, talk to GitHub's API
as you, and, with "Sign in with GitHub", send GitHub's one-time code to a stateless service of the
developer's on Cloudflare that answers with the token and a refresh token and keeps nothing. Nothing
the developer receives or keeps changed.

Version 7 removes the sweep: no workflow on the front door lists SymphonyBoard's installations
every ten minutes and reads each repository they reach to decide whether to offer an adoption,
since installing the App alone is no longer a request, the install sending you to the form, where
the press is; the run reads an installation only when a form carries its number, as the adoption
section now says, and the collector's daily read of the branch `metrics` is as it was. With the
sweep go two things the run did on its path only: it no longer reads a repository's direct
collaborators to find an administrator, since every request names the person who asked, and it no
longer opens an issue in your repository when it could not open its pull request, since the form's
own issue is answered instead. Nothing the developer receives or keeps changed.

Version 6 says that the run, asked for a repository with no commit yet, first makes its first
commit, as GitHub's own "Add a README file" does: a `README.md` holding the repository's name, on the
default branch, which Contents write allows; that it reads whether such a repository has any branch
at all; that closing the pull request leaves that README; and, as it did already, that when the form
carries an installation's number the run asks of each repository both Apps reach what it asks of the
one it adopts. Nothing the developer receives or keeps changed.

Version 5 says that the run also reads the two switches under their names before the rename to
Symphony, `.github/sdlc-adopt` and `.github/sdlc-metrics`; that an adoption never turns on a switch
of the repository's own that says off already, under either name, and brings nothing that shares
where it cannot write the switch; that a repository adopted before the rename turns sharing off in
`.github/sdlc-metrics`, the switch its workflow reads; and that Symphony Setup also uninstalls
itself after a request refused because the repository is adopted already. Nothing the developer
receives or keeps changed.

Version 4 adds the sixth setting Symphony Setup applies: in a repository that takes the whole
template, it ticks "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" where your
organization and its enterprise allow it. It also names what the run reads to leave your settings as
they are: the repository's rulesets, its topics and its workflow permissions for GitHub Actions.
Nothing the developer receives or keeps changed.

Version 3 adds to `METRICS.json` what the work cost, as the section on field metrics describes: the
tokens Claude used, by kind and by model family, their price at Anthropic's API list prices and the
date of that list, the seconds Claude was at work, the counts and rates per merge they are set
against, and the comparison of work done alone with work done in parallel; and it says which
records in your repository the workflow reads to make them, and that the switch stops those records
too. Nothing else changed.

Version 2 adds to `METRICS.json` and `JUDGE.json` the counts of how the work ran in parallel that
the section on field metrics describes, and to `JUDGE.json` how many of its conversations had two or
more people, the number of days it covered and any limit it ran under. It also says what the
workflow reads to make `METRICS.json`, and names what the two files held already and version 1 left
out: the time each was made, the number of days `METRICS.json` covers and the short id of the
protocol's commit, and, in `JUDGE.json`, how many conversations were judged, the totals of the
failure types' three groups, the model, the version of the prompt and the word that names its
schema. Nothing else changed.

Symphony is not a GitHub or Anthropic product. "GitHub" is GitHub's mark; "Claude" and "Claude Code"
are Anthropic's marks, used here to say what Symphony works with.
