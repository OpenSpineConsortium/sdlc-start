"""Small trees for the tests: a fake template and the repositories that adopt it.

The fake template carries tests/fixtures/fake_init.py as its
tools/template_init.py: a stand-in written here, since this public
repository holds no file of the private template, so apply's subprocess
path runs for real while the real init is tested only behind SDLC_TEMPLATE
(tests/test_real_template.py). The placeholders are assembled at run time, as the
template's own tests do, so no file here carries one. Every file's content
stands in for the template's and quotes none of it: a test checks that a
file is there, filled, kept or gone, never the template's own words.
