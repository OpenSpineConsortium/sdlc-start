"""apply against a real checkout of the template, when one is named.

The other tests run on a fake template, since this repository is public and
the template is not, and CI here cannot read it. Whoever can, runs these
too: SDLC_TEMPLATE=/path/to/symphony-template bash scripts/check.sh. Mode new
must leave no placeholder outside the workflows, no marker folder and,
once the template's init empties it, an empty checkpoint block, and read a
setup script that ticks the box for GitHub Actions' pull requests as one;
mode existing must leave a vendored copy that the library's own check
accepts, and workflows whose scripts import only what landed with them and
run there: the template's scripts come to import modules of their own,
which no fake template here can foresee. In both, what the pull request
says is shared must be what the adopted tools/metrics.py reads in the
switches it leaves, and writing on where the pull request says must turn
sharing on: the front door reads the switches by its own code, which the
template's may outgrow.
